# Multiscale simulation of blood flow dynamics in the normal and ischemic coronary circulation

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally according to the WHO and thus are a major burden to health care systems. Adequate functioning of the heart crucially relies on blood supply to the myocardium via its surrounding arteries. Inadequate blood supply due to obstructions of the vessel lumen can lead to myocardial ischemia, which refers to a lack of oxygen supply to the heart tissue. In the extreme case myocardial ischemia results in myocardial infarction (heart attack) and tissue death. Computational modelling of the blood supply chain to the heart can help us better understand the mechanisms of obstructive CVDs such as coronary heart disease and identify risk factors. The aim of this project is to build a mutliscale model of blood supply to the myocardium and explore the effects of myocardial ischemia on various aspects of the blood flow dynamics within the model.
